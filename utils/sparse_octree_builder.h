/*
A class that is able to represent and arbitrary function f : R^3 -> T 
as a sparse octree, where every leaf contains value of function in it's
center. 
T - is a type that can be meaningfully interpolated (i.e. float, double, float2, float3)
It should have T+T and float*T operator and be POD of course. 
Octree always represents unit cube [-1,1]^3
